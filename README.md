**Shadow Bullet**

**Introduction:**

This is a game developed using the C++ programming language along with the OpenGL graphics library. It explores 3D graphics management through real-time rendering techniques, taking a pixel-art approach to maintain a retro visual style.

**Dependencies:**

* OpenGL (Open Graphics Library): A 2D and 3D graphics API (Application Programming Interface).
* GLFW (Graphics Library Framework): An OpenGL library for creating windows and handling input.
* GLAD: An OpenGL loader generator.
* SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library): A cross-platform library written in C++ designed to simplify the development of multimedia applications.
* stb\_image: An open-source (public domain/MIT license) library for loading and, in some cases, saving images in C and C++ applications.
* GLM (OpenGL Mathematics): A mathematics library for graphics software based on the OpenGL Shading Language (GLSL) specifications.
* freeglut: A utility library for OpenGL that provides a basic environment (windows, event handling, main loop) for running OpenGL programs.

**How to Use the Program:**
Use the WASD keys to move around the environment. Move the mouse to change the camera direction.
